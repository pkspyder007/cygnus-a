                    Indian Institute of Information Technology Una is an Institute of National Importance under M.H.R.D India.
                    Due to the COVID-19 the admissions process for new students was stopped due to lockdown. This project helped the college and student to register and make the admission process online.

                    An end to end solution for admission process with admin panel.

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <blockquote>Setting up requirements</blockquote>
                <p>
                    The application was to be consumed by two parties one being the students and second the administration of institute.
                    There was a lot of data and document to be collected and stored for legal purposes hence validating all the data was a necessary part. The admisssion was a lengthy process so data persistance was also an important part.
                    Making sure the student had submiited all the necessary records and uploaded all required and application documents.

                    On the admin side showing various stats, updates, getting student records, uploaded documents, generating pdfs, etc. application responsive for the web users. Although 95% of the client were on mobile but we cannot leave the 5% out.
                </p>
                <blockquote>Data modelling</blockquote>
                <p>
                    <strong>This was really tough and interesting. ü§í</strong>

                    There was a ton of data to be managed keeping low data redundancythere were approx. 15 different forms to be submiited and uploaded. The tricky part waas some of them were mandatory and others not. On top of that few forms were applicable for certain students.
                    Keeping track of on which step a student currently is.
                </p>
                <blockquote>Brideding ends with API</blockquote>
                <p>
                    So we have out frontend components and database models now comes my favourite part working on combining both of them through a <mark>rest api</mark>.
                    This was also really challenging part. I needed to avoid as much code duplication as i could.


                    Securing the API was also a curcial part. For this i went with <mark>JSON Web Tokens</mark> and <mark>custom express.js middlewares</mark> for checkin the authentication of the request.ere it originated and similarly with the payments. Who did the payment, what they paid for, whome the paid, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>Outcome üòç</h2>
                <p>
                    A A really helpful platform for students and institute that helped them to continue the admission process with ease and maintain COVID-19 guidelines.
